# PAWSaroundTOWN
Miriam Munawar, Kim Diep and Amanda Taylor's masterpiece

## Project Introduction
This is a group project as part of the Code First: Girls Beginner's Web Development Course (Autumn 2017) at Twitter, UK.
The website is targetted for animal lovers who like to find animal friendly cafes, or animal-themed cafes in London, UK. It has a map which helps users locate where the cafes are.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project is to apply web development technologies we have learnt to develop a website. Over the past 12 weeks, we attended sessions once a week covering the following: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, GIT, GitHub collaboration, development concepts, Twitter Bootstrap and responsive web development.
